# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
*Challenges are obviously interesting and full of content. It has been challenging to keep in memory things we've learned without using them further. It has been nice to learn that it is ok to look at notes during pairing, challemges or eval.*
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
*I was out of practice for a whole week and fell behind instantly.*
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
*I'm excited to see in practice in what way can we utilize or use the knowledge we've gained during the process of application building.*
